      <p>Peter Griffin is the main character of the American animated sitcom Family Guy. He is voiced
by the series&rsquo; creator, Seth MacFarlane, and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the 15-minute pilot pitch of Family Guy on December 20, 1998. Peter was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry &amp; Steve, a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode &ldquo;Death Has a Shadow&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Peter is married to Lois Griffin and is the father of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He also has a dog named Brian, with whom he is best friends. He has worked at a toy factory, and at Quahog&rsquo;s Brewery. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences.</p>

<p>Peter&rsquo;s voice was inspired by the security guards that MacFarlane heard at his school. His appearance was a redesign of the protagonist Larry from MacFarlane&rsquo;s previous animated short films The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. He has appeared in several pieces of Family Guy merchandise, including toys, T-shirts, and video games, and has made crossover appearances in other shows, including The Simpsons, South Park, Drawn Together, American Dad! and Family Guy&rsquo;s spin-off series The Cleveland Show.</p>

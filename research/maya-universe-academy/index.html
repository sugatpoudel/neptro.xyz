<cite class=research-img-source>Spandan</cite></figcaption></figure><hr class=research-divider><div class=research-content><p>Nestled on the hills of a small highway town in central Nepal, Maya Universe Academy occupies
a unique space within the development of education in the country. It is proudly labeled as
Nepal’s first and only <em>free-private school</em>, flowering in a poor nation where high-quality
education does not come cheap.</p><p>In May of 2019, the Kathmandu Post reported that even though public education received
10.68% of the annual budget, that was only half of what had been promised by the government.
This might be the most recent example of how the nation has stalled in developing its public
education system, and further numbers are there to back it up: in the country’s most
academically advanced city, Kathmandu, over 70% of primary and secondary school students attend
private schools. However, in less developed parts of the country, with an average GDP per
capita of just $835, financial capital for households to fund private education is not available.
Therefore, many families just cannot afford high-quality private education and are forced to
send their children to underfunded and understaffed public schools.</p><h2 id=enter-manjil-rana>Enter Manjil Rana</h2><p>Seeing a major gap in the access to high-quality education for children all around the country,
Manjil Rana and a cohort of youths created the first Maya Universe Academy in Udindhunga,
Tanahun. Now, the group has gone on to establish a total of three schools, educating over
400 children in some of Nepal’s most rural communities.</p><p>Rana said the following in a 2018 presentation in Kathmandu, summarily capturing the uniqueness
of his social enterprise.</p><blockquote><p>We’re not a charity, we haven’t created an
NGO here asking for donations, we have figured out a way to run an institution through
entrepreneurship that makes sure that every child studies for free, and we raise enough money
to run the school in the process</p></blockquote><p>In some of the most economically barren areas of the country, he and his team have managed to
create private institutions that have become self-sustainable.</p><h3 id=maya-s-inception>Maya&rsquo;s Inception</h3><p>When Manjil Rana tells the story of Maya, he tells it from a perspective of a student who
ended up in the United States for his higher education, but was disillusioned after
hearing stories of Nepalis going abroad to work, which heavily influenced his decision to return.
During the same 2018 presentation, Rana said, “You might have a master’s degree, but you
might be in that [foreign] country washing dishes. It’s so hard to even get a visa,
and when you get it you feel like something amazing has happened… we Nepalis do not have much
respect for ourselves when we are abroad.” And so, in 2011, Rana dropped out of his university
in the United States and decided to begin his journey of revolutionizing education at home.</p><p>The founding group of Maya arrived at the location of their first school in Udindhunga
with nothing more than a tent. The humble location was where the school started, and to his
surprise, Rana was reportedly approached by many families within the area. Unsatisfied with
the local public school, these families were willing to entrust their children’s education
on a young change-maker and his friends. Ultimately, though, Maya Universe had to ensure its
self-dependency. And to do this, the schools created a model where every month, the parents
of the children would spend two days working at the school. Initially, this meant that families
would need to help construct the school’s buildings, but afterward, it meant that the
patrons of the institution had to help run the school’s enterprises.</p><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/maya-universe-academy/classroom-lg.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>A Maya classroom
<cite class=research-img-source>Spandan</cite></figcaption></figure><h2 id=maya-s-business-model>Maya’s Business Model</h2><p>Parents in Nepal, on average, are paying up to rs. 500 to rs. 1,000 ($5 - $10) per month on their
children’s education. These are meager sums, and many public schools are therefore reliant on dispersed
NGO funding. At Maya, they figured out early that in order to run their school, they needed to
find a way to raise money in a more efficient manner. Utilizing the same model as constructing the
school, the founders decided that parents would now spend their two days
helping make bracelets.</p><p>Manjil says, “If each family member makes 4 bracelets a day,
and we sell them each for rs. 2,000 each, and after commissions for those selling the
bracelets in the market, each parent could make the school around rs. 6,000 every day.”
Over two days, that’s more than $100. And an additional boost to Maya is that their
bracelets aren’t only being sold to Nepalis, but also to international customers via online
stores. Additionally, the school has also focused on agriculture and
raising animals (chicken, goats, pigs). In fact, in September 2018, an Israeli
volunteer, Shoval Eidan, spent 45 days helping raise 100 anti-biotic free chicken.</p><h2 id=volunteer-networks>Volunteer Networks</h2><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/maya-universe-academy/spandan-with-students-lg.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>Volunteering
<cite class=research-img-source>Spandan</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, in Madrid, Spain, there was a photo exhibition about Maya dedicated to raising funds
for the Maya Universe Academy. The South Asia Institute at Harvard University has a dedicated
page detailing internship opportunities for Harvard students at Maya. Rejina Pariyar, a student
at the Udindhunga school, spent some time in western Europe (Amsterdam and Berlin) in 2019
giving presentations at different colleges about a documentary that was made about her by
Celine and Maret, two Dutch volunteers. In 2018, I also spent two months of my time at Maya
Universe (Udindhunga) teaching English and giving after school classes on Mathematics, Science,
and Social Studies. During my time working at Maya, I worked alongside French, Irish, and
Italian volunteers and a huge cohort of over 20 students from the United States from the
Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps (ROTC) program.</p><p>In short, all of these examples show that Maya’s network of volunteers is vast. I went
during a dry spell due to monsoon rains, which usually dissuade volunteers to make the journey.
However, if one were to visit during either the spring or winter, you can expect the facility
to be sprawling with volunteers. For every day spent in their facility, the institutions
charge $15. This has also become a stable revenue stream for the school. Their vast
volunteer network is unlike any other and is due in some parts to the closeness that volunteers
experience with the students and the overall school mission.</p><h2 id=maya-s-social-model>Maya’s Social Model</h2><p>Maya, in Nepali, means love, and love is a guiding principle of how all three Maya
Universe Academies are run. Every morning, students, volunteers, staff, and administrators
gathered in a circle. After a minute of eyes-closed self-reflection, everyone hugs the
person to their left and right. Often during lunch breaks, the entire school
(including the principals), can be seen playing cricket or grabbing a bite with the students.
Most importantly, you would never see a child being hit by any of the teachers. In a country
where corporal punishment is still heavily tolerated, and discipline is cultivated through
fear rather than respect, Maya’s social model&ndash;like its economic model&ndash;is unprecedented.</p><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/maya-universe-academy/students-1-lg.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>Maya students
<cite class=research-img-source>Spandan</cite></figcaption></figure><h2 id=long-term-results>Long-term results</h2><p>Maya’s revolutionary economic and social models are backed up with results from the first
batch of Maya students who took the Secondary Education Exam (SEE). The SEE is taken by all
graduating 10th-grade students and has notoriously been known as the <em>iron-gate</em> in Nepali
education. And the first-batch of Maya students who took the SEE exam was up for the challenge.
The graduating batch of 25 students consisted of 9 B&rsquo;s and 15 A&rsquo;s. These are
exceptional results, especially in comparison to national averages: in 2017, over half the
exam-takers had a grade of C+ or lower.</p><p>The example of Maya Universe Academy provides a solid framework for running high-quality
education institutions in some of the most rural parts of the country. It is also
embarrassing for the public school system to be outdone by young social entrepreneurs who
started from a tent. But the most important part is that these schools have set an example,
that if replicated, might have the chance to change the lives of the poorest in the most
underdeveloped parts of the country.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><a class="site-brand-md footer-title" href=/>neptro</a><div class=footer-content><div class=footer-description>exploring an alternate side of Nepal through emerging trends and technology</div><p class=footer-disclaimer>Most of the research conducted on neptro has been done through

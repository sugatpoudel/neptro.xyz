<cite class=research-img-source>unsplash</cite></figcaption></figure><hr class=research-divider><div class=research-content><p>Nestled between two massive and burgeoning economies, Nepal has largely
been lying dormant while its neighbors have witnessed a technological
upheaval within the past decade. However, the increase in internet accessibility
has led to the rise of tech companies within Nepal that have begun uprooting
long-standing institutions; one such institution being the complicated and
unavoidable world of finance.</p><p>Due to an absurdly high mobile and internet
penetration, Nepal has started to see mobile wallets slowly creep into the
country. They stand to fundamentally change how citizens carry out their lives
with larger implications for the economic growth and financial literacy of the
entire country.</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Political instability has been the continuous norm for Nepali citizens
considering that there have been several political upheavals since the
introduction of democracy in 1990. There is currently a top down effort from the
new federalist government to implement reforms that supposedly set the country on
a path to become a <a href=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/358501495199225866/pdf/115156-CEM-PUBLIC-SAREC-70p-Country-Economic-Memorandum-19-May-2017.pdf>middle income economy by 2030</a>.
With only eleven years to go, this is quite a lofty goal for a country where
remittances make up 31.3% of the GDP and 25.2% of the population lives below the national poverty line.</p><p>These reforms would need to directly tackle the widespread lack of infrastructure
for water, electricity, and transportation along with curbing the emigration rate
that has slowly been crippling the talent pool within Nepal. While neighboring
countries have boosted their economies by piggybacking off of export led growth,
Nepal has been falling behind by becoming increasingly import dependent. A slight
import bottleneck has the potential to bring the entire country to a standstill
like the post earthquake oil blockade in 2015.</p><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/digital-wallets-in-nepal/oil-blockade-bikes-lg.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>2015 oil blockade
<cite class=research-img-source>neptro</cite></figcaption></figure><p>This trade deficit directly hampers industrialization and job creation; despite
these challenges, the country has been experiencing a steady economic growth over
the last few years (a whopping 7.5% in 2016-17). Moreover, the country has seen a
significant improvement in telecommunications infrastructure largely in part due
to investments from leading telecom providers. The use of mobile phones
skyrocketed to 113% in 2017, meaning that there were more phones in use than
people.</p><p>Analogously, internet penetration has steadily increased with Nepal
Telecom reporting that, approximately 250 people were coming online every hour in
2017. The key driver of this explosion relates to how Nepali citizens have been
embracing social media. Facebook boasts a whopping 9.3 million user base in Nepal
alone. This has tangibly affected media consumption patterns within the country
as people are looking to Facebook and Youtube for real time news updates despite
the source’s veracity. The largest adopters have been more younger crowds,
largely in part due to their education and influence from abroad.</p><h2 id=emerging-platforms>Emerging Platforms</h2><p>Despite their increasing encroachment in the South Asian market, platforms like
Amazon and Uber are not household names in Nepal as they are in the United
States. This can be attributed to the lack of required infrastructure and the
fact that the value proposition is not directly transferable to a Nepali user
base. For a technology company to be successful in this climate, it needs to
understand and cater to the needs of Nepalis and their sensibilities. It needs to
be something that takes a grassroots approach and develops and adapts processes
and techniques to fit and even complement the current context.</p><p>Daraz is a rising ecommerce platform that is starting to see steady growth in
Nepal. They currently claim around 700,000 impressions per month and are hoping
to boost that figure to 2.5 million in the next couple of years. Daraz is a
family of online shopping portals catering to South Asian countries such as
Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal. It is owned by the Chinese behemoth
alibaba and bears a striking visual and operational resemblance. The company has
a long way to go before they begin to shift buyer patterns in Nepal however they
have began implementing effective measures to get there.</p><p>Nepal has a very weak physical address system. The streets lining the densely
packed houses in urban areas often don’t have a name and the houses themselves
are not properly numbered. The last mile (kilometer) problem is crucial to the
success of an ecommerce platform. Rather than waiting for the Nepali postal
service to be reformed, Daraz relies on is own delivery company, Daraz express,
to deliver packages to customers. They seem to be slowly building a network of
localized delivery hubs with local experts navigating to a given <em>address</em>. They
already have seven such hubs in Kathmandu and one in Pokhara.</p><p>Moreover, there is the obvious problem of payment. Currently Daraz only accepts
cash on delivery. This is an ingenious way to remove any hurdles for people
hesitant to ecommerce however it faces problems with scale. They have already
begun working with digital payment gateways and are projecting that 50% of their
payments to the digital by the end of this year. Their customer centric approach
is helping build trust among their users with their favorable return policy and
quality control.</p><h2 id=digital-wallets>Digital Wallets</h2><p>With a hyperactive smartphone user base, a digital portal where users can send
and receive money within Nepal makes a lot of sense. There are two major
companies providing such services today, the longstanding <strong>eSewa</strong> and the
relatively new <strong>Khalti</strong>. Both companies offer a digital wallet that seeks to
make financial transactions a breeze for the average nepali. A mobile wallet, much
like the name implies, is a virtual wallet that stores payment information and is
capable of sending and receiving money on your behalf. It serves as a viable
replacement for your actual wallet considering that the other end of your
transaction accepts it.</p><p>Such platforms have existed in other countries for a
while such as paypal in the United States or alipay in China. Within the past few
years, Nepal has seen increasing usage of the two mobile wallet platforms with
implications for macro-level societal changes.</p><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/digital-wallets-in-nepal/wallets-lg.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>digital wallets
<cite class=research-img-source>neptro</cite></figcaption></figure><h3 id=esewa>eSewa</h3><p>Developed under the umbrella of f1soft, a well regarded fintech company, eSewa is
inarguably the most popular digital payment service provider in Nepal. Released
in 2009, eSewa has seen steady growth every year with the number of mobile wallet
transactions starting to grow significantly around 2014. eSewa allows users to
make payments to merchants, transfer funds to and from a bank and even send
remittances within their mobile app. eSewa’s strength lies in their vast network
of merchants and their many partnership with common vendors. Users can buy
anything from movie tickets to domestic flights. Their customer driven platform
carries cashback offers and discounts from many popular vendors as a way to
attract and retain customers.</p><p>With almost a decade of experience under their belt, eSewa has tried to minimize
possible impediments between its services and a potential user. They maintain
integrations with over 50 banks and financial institutions making it easy for
users to transfer money to and from their eSewa account. Moreover, users can
access their vast network of 46,000 agents all over Nepal. In terms of scale,
eSewa currently processes around 158,000 transactions worth rs. 40.7 million on
merchants payments alone.</p><p>Handling financial transactions of this magnitude is a
technological feat that requires many engineers and operation experts ensuring
that user experience does not degrade when facing an increase in volume.
Furthermore, as eSewa is still a private enterprise, they need to ensure their
business model is still profitable as they invest more time and money in their
platform.</p><h3 id=khalti>Khalti</h3><p>Khalti is an emerging online payment solution in Nepal. Launched in 2017, under
the shadow of eSewa, they have quickly grown to become a laudable competitor with
many of the same service offerings. The company’s payment solutions and marketing
are aimed at promoting a cashless society. They maintain more than 8,000 points
of sale and merchant integrations throughout Nepal. They are pursuing a brand
that seeks to drive innovation by making people’s lives easier. Their offerings
highlight being able to pay electricity and water bills right from the user’s
phone.</p><p>As a more recent company, Khalti lacks the vast network and integrations of
eSewa. However they are attempting to attract more customers using generous
offers, bonuses and cashback. Recently, they partnered with motorola to offer
users up to rs. 2000 for new motorola smartphones. This strategy seeks to
habituate digital payments among smartphone users in order to make using digital
wallets a norm. Their campaigns have started showing results and they have beens
seeing 18% growth every month, with around 800,000 users using their services for
various bill payments.</p><h2 id=usage>Usage</h2><p>For a platform to find its footing among a nascent user base, they need a “killer
app” that drives usage. For eSewa and Khalti, that killer app has been bill
payments. eSewa allows users to pay their electricity, water, and subscription
bills online. Their website even mentions integrations with certain schools to
help parents pay tuition. Nepalis have been used to waiting around in long queues
for an unreasonable amount of time to pay for their recurring costs. Take for
instance <a href=https://kathmandupost.com/money/2019/03/08/digital-wallet-and-payment-services-see-uptick-in-users>Binay Regmi</a>, a school teacher, who used to pay late fees on his
electricity bill because he did not have time to stand in line and wait to pay at
the cash counter of Nepal Electricity Authority. With online payment services, he
was able to skip the lines entirely and pay his bills on time every month. Bill
payments is a practical service that has far reaching implications than simply
saving users time.</p><p>Nepali institutions have many layers of bureaucracy that heavily burdens
citizens. Aside from making simple administrative tasks more painstaking, they
end up resulting in huge operational costs that effectively slowing down
institutions. An immediate result of digital bill payments has been a reduction
of foot traffic in bill payment centers. The Nepali government itself has taken
notice and they expect foot traffic to decrease further as they seek to launch
their own digital payment system. This trend would actively cut down or at the
very least mire the need for logistics personnel. In the near and idealistic
future, this could result in a slow and steady institutional restructuring that
removes humans from more monotonous and administrative tasks while giving them
more creative and impactful opportunities.</p><p>This change is already visible with both eSewa and Khalti expanding integrations
with water and electricity service providers. eSewa alone is handling around
rs. 10 million a day for 10,000 customers simply on electricity bill payments.</p><h2 id=ramifications>Ramifications</h2><div class=youtube-video><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9sTSXSy10I frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Take the eSewa commercial above. It is characteristically Nepali in language,
context and mannerism. It showcases a seamless integration of an encounter that
occurs hundreds of times all over Nepal with digital wallets. The value
proposition of both eSewa and Khalti is primarily just convenience. This is a
powerful insight that both companies know will make them mainstays in Nepali
commerce for years to come.</p><p>They are leading a quiet disruption that won’t be
visible overnight but overtime their services will surely come to encompass every
common financial transaction to the point where having an eSewa or Khalti account
will be as commonplace as rain during the monsoon. Emerging technology companies
need to understand product growth in Nepal needs to stem from the ground up. One
cannot simply emulate a service in Nepal without realizing the idiosyncrasies the
culture carries, which would undoubtedly affect user behavior.</p><p>Beneath the steady success of these digital payment platforms, there looms
questions regarding customer privacy and financial security. Nepal, as of yet,
has not had any major cases of user facing tech companies dealing with data
breaches. However as Khalti and eSewa begin scaling out, they could be potential
targets for bad actors. Furthermore, these companies are private entities and
although they seek to benefit most by protecting their users, their
accountability still lies with maintaining their business. On that note, Nepal
Rastra Bank has recently started requiring a payment service provider
<a href=https://www.nrb.org.np/psd/policies/Payment_System_Oversight_Framework_2018_20741108.pdf>license</a>
for companies that provide online and mobile payment services. With the
introduction of this policy, NRB effectively functions as an oversight body that
helps ensure that these companies are capable of honoring all outstanding
transactions. This ultimately provides a stronger guarantee to end users that
their finances are safe at the hands of electronic middlemen.</p><p>While most digital wallet users are concentrated in urban areas, rural residents
seek to gain the most with eSewa and Khalti. With the ability to carry out fund
transfers through a smartphone app, financial access is opened up to
conventionally marginalized groups. This is a huge step forward towards financial
empowerment. Nepal’s telecom infrastructure has been steadily improving coverage
in more rural areas and with the ubiquity of smartphones, there stands to be a
shift in how these groups access money.</p><p>eSewa and Khalti both understand this
importance and have sought to expand their network to better serve rural areas.
eSewa plans to open up service branches throughout the country in an attempt to
expand coverage. Khalti has launched workshops and a dedicated
<a href=https://khalti.com/smart-chhori/>Smart Chhori</a> program to increase financial
literacy among adolescent girls. This is a huge step forward towards achieving
systemic independence for the marginalized, at
least from a financial perspective, as they can now access financial services
that historically were only available at the hands of unreachable institutions.</p><p>The rise of digital payment platform is bringing about a cultural shift that the
average Nepali stands to benefit from. Although the long term effect of such
technologies are still nebulous, they show great promise. Despite being
competitors, eSewa and Khalti stand to gain a lot from their rivalry as they have
a constant drive to innovate and output the best possible service for their
users. These are exciting times in Nepal and it seems to foreshadow a changing
technological landscape that can perhaps elevate the country even further and lay
the groundwork for upcoming technological innovations.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><a class="site-brand-md footer-title" href=/>neptro</a><div class=footer-content><div class=footer-description>exploring an alternate side of Nepal through emerging trends and technology</div><div class=footer-copyright>© 2020 neptro</div></div></footer></body></html>

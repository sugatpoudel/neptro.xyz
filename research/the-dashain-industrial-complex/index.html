<cite class=research-img-source>neptro</cite></figcaption></figure><hr class=research-divider><div class=research-content><p>Nepalis are reinforced that Dashain is a time for consumption at a young age and
extreme consumer culture still continues today.</p><blockquote><p>I was sitting uncomfortably with my legs crossed while my grandmother finished
throwing tika all over my brand new clothes. After completing her blessings, she
pulled out a crisp new 50 rupee bill and handed it to me. I was grinning ear to ear,
because this was cold hard CASH ready to be spent immediately. This is how I remember
most of my childhood Dashains.</p></blockquote><p>In 2018, Nepal’s household consumption expenditure totaled $21 billion, which represented
~73% of annual GDP. Historically, Nepalis have maintained a high household consumption
expenditure to GDP ratio. Nepalis already spend a tremendous amount of money throughout the year,
but consumption during Dashain and Tihar increases significantly. According to the annual
household consumption survey conducted in 2016 - 2017, average monthly household consumption
expenditure totaled रू200 billion, but during festival times the average monthly
household consumption expenditures tripled to रू600 billion.</p><canvas id=householdConsumption class=chart-diagram></canvas><p>Significant purchases on consumer goods, meat, and mass travel all contribute to the
increased consumption during this time period. Many of these goods are sourced
domestically and through international trade partners like India and China. More
interestingly, funding sources for goods and services during Dashain display the
importance of this festival, as many Nepalis fund purchases by using savings,
remittances, and dashain bonuses.</p><h2 id=consumer-habits>Consumer Habits</h2><p>Dashain is comparable to consumerist centric holidays in the United States, like
Christmas and Thanksgiving. Similar to business practices during the holidays in
the States, customers are incentivized to spend their money, because merchants provide
tremendous deals on outdated inventory. Nepali citizens are approached with sales
and discounts from both boutique merchants for clothing and multinational corporations
for bigger ticket items such as cars, appliances, and other electronics.</p><p>One of the most obvious displays of corporate competition is found in Nepal’s
automotive space. Large multinational automobile manufacturers compete by giving customers
huge incentives to purchase cars, bikes, and scooters. For example, this year,
Nissan and Tata both advertised chances to win travel packages to various countries in
Asia and Africa. In addition to travel packages, auto dealers also provide large cash
back offers, gold coins (through lottery), vehicle servicings, house cleanings,
insurance policies, and financing. Magnitudes of cash discount offers varied,
but the largest went up to रू10 Lakhs.</p><figure class=research-img><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/np-article-images/the-dashain-industrial-complex/nissan.jpg><figcaption class=research-img-caption>nissan&#39;s festive drive
<cite class=research-img-source>nepaldrives</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the auto dealers, smartphone manufacturers also provide hefty incentives to
purchase smart phone. Cell phone manufacturers like Huawei, Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi offer
significant cash discounts and trips to locations like Bali, Baku, and Thailand. Special
offers like a chance to win trips, free gold coins, and cash back rewards are all ways to
incentivize customers to purchase consumer discretionary products. Merchants are quick
to provide incentives for discretionary goods, but their behavior is opposite for
consumer staple goods.</p><h2 id=increased-prices-for-consumer-staples>Increased Prices for Consumer Staples</h2><h3 id=vegetation>Vegetation</h3><p>The root of price hikes for consumer staples and commodities during Dashain can be
traced back to simple principles of supply and demand. Domestic production of fruits
and vegetables cannot sustain the demand that Nepalis have during non-festival times.
In 2014, 27% of fruits and vegetables sold in the Kalimati Fruit and Vegetable Market,
the largest marketplace in Kathmandu, were imported from India. In 2017, Nepal Rastra Bank
reported that Nepal’s total vegetable imports from India totaled रू10 billion, but during
the festival seasons Nepal had imported vegetables valued between रू1-2 billion for
the prior three years, Nepal’s key produce imports include Rice, Vegetables, and Fruits.</p><canvas id=consumerStaples class=chart-diagram></canvas><p>In 2017, the Nepalese government launched a 10-year initiative to decrease its
reliance on vegetable imports from India by urging Nepali farmers to adopt modern
farming techniques to increase self-sustaining produce volumes. Recently, Nepali vegetable
imports from India were halted at the border, because customs had increased surveillance on
pesticide infused vegetables. Nepali citizens witnessed vegetable prices increase by
nearly 200% due to mandatory testing for pesticides and lack of domestic vegetable
production levels, which currently meet 30% of the country’s demand. Vegetable demand
requirements total 1,300 tons and over 70% of the demand is fulfilled by Indian imports.
As initiatives to decrease Indian imports take place, local merchants have opportunities to
increase prices. During this year’s Dashain prices for Green Beans went up from
रू38 per kg to रू98 per kg, and prices for Karela (Bitter Cucumber) rose to रू136 per
kg from रू33-रू78 per kg.</p><h2 id=supply-and-demand-in-relation-to-goats>Supply and Demand In Relation to Goats</h2><p>Increase demand during festival time is most evident through Nepali consumption of goat.
Goats are a crucial part of Dashain, as both an instrument of religious worship
(as the literal sacrificial lamb) and as an expensive delicacy. In 2017, the number of
goats sold in Kathmandu during Dashain totaled ~67,500. To support the high demand of goats,
government backed, Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) supplied ~2,500 goats for a subsidized price
of रू455 per kg. The remainder of 65,000 goats were provided through local livestock traders,
who sell their inventory for an average price of रू500 per kg. In the previous year the NFC
and local livestock traders sold goats at a subsidized rate of रू450 per kg and an
average price of 450 per kg, respectively. Local livestock traders
raised their prices by 11% year-over-year due to increased transportation costs.</p><p>In 2019, more than 75,000 goats and sheep were required to fulfill demand in Kathmandu.
This increase in demand is correlated to increases in pricing. Rates for live and mountain
goats sourced through private traders during this year’s Dashain were रू660 per kg and
रू800 per kg, respectively. As for goats and mountain goats purchased through government
agencies like the Food Management and Trading Company, subsidized prices increased
slightly to रू550 and रू730, respectively. Months prior to this year’s Dashian, the Nepali
government nearly halted goat imports from India due to lack of authenticated animal health
records, resulting in record high prices of रू1,300 per kg. Artificial price hikes
from local vendors took place, because India supplies nearly 75% of all goats sold in Nepal.</p><h3 id=direct-competition-from-the-south>Direct Competition from the South</h3><p>Effects of Indian influence on festival related consumer activities are prevalent in
Indian border towns like Sunauli and Raxaul. In 2016, Nepali entrepreneurs estimated that
they lost nearly रू50 million in daily purchase volume to Indian merchants located in
Sunauli. ~5,000 Nepalis from various districts flocked to Sunauli on a daily basis to
purchase commodities, electrical appliances, clothing, spices, and other goods. In Raxual,
merchants experienced daily sales totaling रू10 million during festival times primarily
by selling to Nepalis. Nearly 90% of all customers in Raxaul are Nepali. Nepalis are
attracted to Indian border towns because they carry higher quality textiles, saris,
and kurthas. However, their spending is only beneficial to the Indian merchants south
of the border.</p><p>Nepali entrepreneurs lose out their local customers due to a lack of
supply and quality of goods. Additionally, the Nepali government foregos taxation revenue,
because purchases were made in a foreign country. The government previously
made efforts to tax purchases over रू1,000, but discovered that it is incredibly
difficult to operationally enforce taxation efforts, given many Nepalis carry
suitcases full of clothing across the border prior to purchasing goods in India.</p><h3 id=influx-of-travellers-during-the-festivities>Influx of Travellers During the Festivities</h3><p>As Nepalis leave to shop in India during Dashain, many more tourists and non-residential Nepalis (NRNs) arrive
in Nepal to participate in the festivities. In 2016, foreign tourist arrivals totalled
753,002, representing Rs. 49 billion in expenditures. Foreign tourism volumes for 2017
exceeded expectations by 17%. In 2017, expected arrival volumes were ~800,000, however
actual arrival volumes were ~940,000 resulting in रू65 billion in expenditures.</p><canvas id=tourismVolume class=chart-diagram></canvas><p>Dashain has become a global experience for Nepalis. In 2017, Nepali outbound travellers
contributed रू80 billion in total spend. Because Nepal is in close proximity to exotic
locations in Asia, many Nepalis have opted to travel to these destinations for Dashian.
Many Nepalis also travel abroad to celebrate Dashian with family members in other countries.
Visiting family members throughout the country is a big part of Dashain. It was estimated
that earlier this year, nearly three million Nepalis left Kathmandu to take part in
festivities. Public and private transportation services are required to service the
significant outflow of Nepalis.</p><p>According to the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, Kathmandu will require
9,000 busses to transport travelers. Prior to 2004, transportation entrepreneurs cooperated
with the increased demand for busses and regulatory changes (Transportation Management Directive).
The Transportation Management Directive attempted to end syndicate and cartel like behavior,
since then, entrepreneurs have ceased to cooperate by buying new busses to service
travelers. Long-term results of this policy include prepaid tickets, black markets,
and increased prices by as much as 20%.</p><h2 id=sources-of-funds>Sources of Funds</h2><p>To fund steep prices for consumer discretionary goods, consumer staples, or spend on travel,
Nepalis rely heavily on remittances, dashain bonuses, and in some cases loans. Remittance,
money sent back from non-residential Nepalis, contributed to 31% of Nepal’s GDP in 2016,
totaling $6.6 billion. On a monthly basis, Nepalis working abroad send back
~रू55 billion ($513 million). This flow of funds increases by nearly 20% - 25% during Dashain.
Millions of Nepalis working in other parts of the world send additional funds during
festival season, because celebrating all traditional aspects of Dashian is
display of social status for Nepalis.</p><p>Nepalis also rely on their Dashain bonuses to purchase goods. Dashain bonuses are
state-mandated bonuses under the Bonus Act. Under the Bonus Act, all companies in Nepal
have to allocate 10% of profits for distribution among employees. The amount you receive
as a bonus is dependent on your base salary. On average, 70% of the allocated amount is
distributed among employees and the remaining 30% is used for the national welfare fund.
Earlier this year, the government proposed amendments to the Bonus act. The proposed
amendments would result in significant reduction of bonus payouts for employees. Amendments
to the act have been opposed by employees for obvious reasons and by employers for
the fear of losing good employees.</p><p>Increased cash flows from remittances and Dashain bonuses contribute significantly
to many Nepali people’s ability to celebrate Dashain. It is unclear how much of this
increased cash flow is being saved for future investment or emergency savings.</p><h2 id=disconnect-in-priorities>Disconnect in Priorities</h2><p>The business impacts of Dashain are not easily quantifiable, but at a glance it is easy to
conclude that Dashain contributes to seasonality in prices for many goods. Impacts of
high prices for goods are eased by incentives in the market. It is very evident that there
is significantly more interest in the market for consumer discretionary goods. There are
many incentives for consumers to purchase discretionary goods, however many people are
facing price hikes and shortages for consumer staples. Misaligned incentives indicate an
ironic disconnect in priorities from merchants and consumers.</p><p>Priorities during Dashian root from a <em>Keeping up with the Joneses</em> mentality. Social
status driven spending causes people to utilize funds that they cannot afford to use.
Changing long lasting traditions and mindsets for a large group of people is an uphill battle.
On an institutional level, new investments should be implemented, so Nepalis do not have to
rely as much on foreign trade. There have been recent efforts to make Nepal self-sustaining,
but these efforts seem to be too fast paced for the market. These efforts should be
gradual and the seasonal effects of Dashain on the market should be taken under
consideration in these efforts. Sudden changes from government involvement leads
to predatory business practices. Predatory business practices coupled with
spendthrift consumers result in a distasteful cocktail of unsustainable economic activity.</p></div></div></section><section></section><script src=/js/dashain-charts.dc02355528ccd5e9ab32f65e9bceb93ee2279e418babd9df0c246ee95e18c22a.js></script></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><a class="site-brand-md footer-title" href=/>neptro</a><div class=footer-content><div class=footer-description>Exploring an alternate side of Nepal through
